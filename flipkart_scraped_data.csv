READ MORE | This is the best camera phone is segments | Heating issue n also camera is ok ok | Good Quality
Camera is Awesome
Design Is Best In This Section | Must buy | Love this phone | Awesome phone the navy color looks so good, design is fantastic. Speakers r not like Samsung with default settings but when slider is set to 15-20% towards R the effect increases. The caller speaker (L) acts as a 2nd speaker so thats why sound quality weakens on default. Depends on person to person.
A single charge 100% at around 9am will give all day backup (without heavy usage like games and all).
But its a go for it phone for sure. No regrets. Delivery was very slow that's the only issue. | Very good üëç | Good Quality | Worth to buy‚ú®Ô∏è

Good design, good display, decent performance, good camera, good battery backup. Only flaw I can regret to say is the full volume of the speaker is pretty low compared to other mobiles even on a low budget.

Good buy üëç | Most powerful laptop out there. | I ordered Macbook Air - 8GB RAM and 512GB Storage. I am happy with this product. It's expensive but it is valuable product and worth to have it. I am also happy with Flipkart services. I received it within 3 days. I recommended to buy this kind of expensive product from Flipkart as well. | ‚ù£Ô∏èü•∞ I love it.. ‚ù£Ô∏è | Performance of Mac is much superior as compared to any windows machine. If you are concerned w.r.t productivity and efficiency of your efforts on laptop, choose Macbook.

For my needs, M2 gives most value for money.

CAUTION - Beware of the fact that if you are switching from windows ecosystem, you will need to put spend substantial efforts in first 2-3 weeks to learn Mac commands and shortcuts. | It's a excellent choice, specially if you are buying it for work, free lancing and to learn new skills, It is great in both performance and battery in this price. Absolutely buy it. Giving it a 4 star as the piece I got has a little tight hinge and it won't open single handedly, which doesn't give a good Impression, and I can't even return it now and have to go apple service centre, But be real everybody doesn't have time to waste a whole day for this problem. | Amazing | sleek and does the work flawlessly | good performance 15 hr battery backup | A good product but still I don't think it is value for money. Below 90k, this will be the best. But the product is great for anyone except gamers | Good product ,battery backup also good | If coming from Windows, it'll take a few weeks to adapt to mac OS, once you're in, it's easy to use. Display is so good. You don't feel you're missing amoled display. It's a treat to watch apple tv here. Good battery life... gives 10-12 hrs backup with normal usage. Speakers are clear crisp but not loud, you need to connect external speakers for better sound. Got this machine for 83k in bbd extra 15k for apple care..if you have budget go for m3..... overall happy to be a macbook user | As a windows user, I was sceptical about purchasing it though I very much wanted to have it. After spending much time in dilemma on whether to buy it or not, I took the leap and purchased it.
It's authentic, genuine and professional inclusive of its functions and outlook.
Getting used to it will take some time, however I believe that it will be worthy.
Additionally it's not for serving gaming purpose, rather professional purpose . For gaming you can purchase from other brands like asus, hp...

Awesome performance, good battery life of about 14-16 hours. Very happy with the purchase. | Best product.... | Best laptop with good deal. | Just wanted to clear some things;
1) if you're considering it for coding and AI ML , Please any variant with 16GB RAM.. as you can cannot make heavy projects smoothly in this laptop.

2) if 60 hdz screen bothers you, this isn't for you. Go for the pro variant.

3) Battery backup is top notch.

Everything is best this, go for it without any double thought. | slimmest and powerful , but 8gb ram is not enough for coders who do multitasking at same time. | Osm product | The product is good.

The performance it delivers is just unmatched. On practical usage, it can easily beat the high-end Windows laptops. You are gonna love it from the moment you unbox it and would kinda wanna eat it once it falls in your hands.

READ MORE | A good power pack laptop to go with, | This is a great device as a personal laptop or work machine. The Full HD camera is a welcome addition. 6 month M365 subscription is free with this machine and that is a good add-on benefit. The small notch around the camera in the top middle of the screen is pretty neatly integrated and does not disturb. The build quality is fantastic and form factor is perfect to hold and operate. | Its very good product. | Product is nice but price droped by 6k after purchasing so feels a bit dispointed. | This is my first macbook...was using windows since 3rd grade ...both are different but macOS feels so smooth and optimised.

As soon as I setted it up ... I got one update... offcourse I updated my Mac.

I am loving this product... Especially the screen corners are so thin with least bezels..
Battery life is amazing...used moderately for 1 day.. discharged 50 % | First mac and it works like a beast | Purchased (16GB RAM + 256GB SSD) variant for 69.5k only.So far everything good ,Later will share my experience for this device. | Very nice | Superb | Just got the product, While detailed review will updated after couple of months usage.

But yeah it lasts around 10 hours and I think for most of the guys that's sufficient. It's a 16 GB variant and this runs as smooth as water (trust me). For coding guys, nothing can beat it afaik.

Literally M2's have crucial or beast performance no doubt.

No complaints with this product | I'll just say, THE BEST üåπ | Excellent machine.. sleek and stylish | Love the Macbook Air. I've had the 2018 version for 15 months now. Here are the Pros and Cons, in my experience:
Pro:
Battery - the main reason I chose the Air. I'm averaging 8-9 hrs per charge, keeping the brightness around 2/3rd. For writers, this is extremely liberating. However, Higher brightness depletes the battery faster.
Performance - Clich√©d but true: Osx is smooth! It's not even a fair contest with Windows, which is too clunky. Osx and the Air have made for a fantastic experience.

For my needs, M2 gives most value for money.

CAUTION - Beware of the fact that if you are switching from windows ecosystem, you will need to put spend substantial efforts in first 2-3 weeks to learn Mac commands and shortcuts. | It's a excellent choice, specially if you are buying it for work, free lancing and to learn new skills, It is great in both performance and battery in this price.

It's authentic, genuine and professional inclusive of its functions and outlook.

The capacity of my engine is slightly more than 1L, hence the oil level seems to fall low very fast. If you change the oil filter. You should buy two packs, as the engine will need around 100 mL more oil. Rest everything is positive about the product. | product reached safely with good package.

If going for long ride then it is recommended or else better to use the company grade oil. If you rav the engine with full RPM then use it. Continuous driving in highway above 80kmph or beyond that then it is useful. Not meant for city use. | Have been using Motul semi synthetic oil for 5 times in a row. Never disappointed. My pulsar 150 is very smooth and has only low amount of heat in long travel. Both 5100 and 7100 (fully synthetic) are good. | My experience with Motul 5100 15W-50 is a positive one. The local mechanic was using a local brand and that oil used to drain quickly. As a result, oil change was frequent too. More money for him though.

This is semi-synthetic which in simple English means that if you ride your bike daily for short commutes then semisynthetic oil is suitable for you. Personally, I drove around 4000 KMs on 2.5L of this in 6 months before changing the oil. Your bike will let you know when it needs an oil chang...

1st time going to try motul 5100 on my age old ambition 135. Earlier, i used she'll ax7 (lasts for 2000 kms only) for more than 5 yrs then accidentally tried Mobil semi synthetic (lasts around 2500 kms) I felt huge positive changes in engine notice and temperature while using Mobil than she'll ax7.
Now trying motul 5100 as recommended by my friend.
Riding pattern mostly city traffic and highway ride. | Best oil, Used before. | Very good experience using this product | I used it on My Apache rtr 160..
