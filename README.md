  - Detailed user reviews (up to 50 per product)
  - Product URLs and search terms
  - Breadcrumb navigation data
- **Anti-Detection Measures**:
  - Headless browser operation
  - Automation detection bypass
  - Random delays between requests (1.5-2.5 seconds)
  - User-agent manipulation
  - Window size simulation
- **Error Handling**:
  - CAPTCHA detection and graceful handling
  - Connection error recovery
  - Missing element handling
- **Data Export**: Automatic CSV export with comprehensive product information

### Sentiment Analysis

- **Review Processing**: Analyzes customer reviews to determine sentiment
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses state-of-the-art transformer models for accurate sentiment classification
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes large volumes of reviews
- **Sentiment Metrics**: Provides detailed sentiment scores and analysis

python Final_Code.py
```

2. The script will automatically scrape data for these categories:

   - Samsung Phones
   - MacBooks
   - Remote Control Cars
   - Engine Oil
   - Antidepressants

3. Progress will be displayed in the console, showing:
   - Current search term being processed
   - Number of products found
   - Review collection progress
   - Any errors or CAPTCHA detections

### Sentiment Analysis

1. Run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Flipkart_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
```

2. The notebook will:
   - Load the scraped data
   - Process and clean the reviews
   - Perform sentiment analysis
   - Generate visualizations and insights

### Sentiment Analysis (flipkart_data_with_sentiment.csv)

- Original scraped data
- Sentiment scores
- Sentiment classifications
- Category-wise sentiment distribution

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Web Scraping

- **Browser Automation**:

  - Selenium WebDriver with Chrome in headless mode
  - Automated ChromeDriver installation via webdriver_manager
  - Custom Chrome options for anti-bot measures

- **Concurrent Processing**:
  - ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel product scraping
  - Configurable worker pool (default: 10 workers)
  - Automatic thread management and cleanup

### Sentiment Analysis

- **Model**: Transformer-based sequence classification
- **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning and normalization
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large datasets
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA support for faster processing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate Limiting & Ethics

- Random delays between requests (1.5-2.5 seconds)
- CAPTCHA detection and graceful termination
- Respects Flipkart's robots.txt
- Limited to 50 reviews per product
- Concurrent requests limited to 10

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **CAPTCHA Detection**: If encountered, the script will skip the current page and continue
- **Missing Elements**: Gracefully handled with None values
- **Network Issues**: Automatic retry mechanism for failed requests
- **Memory Usage**: Close browser instances after each scrape
- **Chrome Issues**: Ensure latest Chrome browser is installed
- **GPU Memory**: Adjust batch size for sentiment analysis if running out of memory
